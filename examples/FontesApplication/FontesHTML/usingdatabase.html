	 <P ALIGN="LEFT"> <B>Fontes Database</B> - takes you into the database on
		the CD-ROM </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Information</B> - takes you to a variety of documents
		giving you information about the project and its use </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Fontes on the Web</B> - takes you into the database on
		the web (for which you will need to have a browser and an internet link) </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">2. Click on <B>Information</B> to go into the files about
		the project and the database. Follow the links to navigate. To return to the
		opening screen use the Back button at the top or the Fontes Database button at
		the bottom.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">3. Clicking on <B>Fontes Database</B> takes you into the
		CD-ROM version of the database. The default page is <FONT
		COLOR="#993333"><B>Anglo-Saxon Texts</B></FONT> and shows a list of the
		Anglo-Saxon authors and works which are included in the database.</P> 
	 <H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="AStexts"></A>Anglo-Saxon Texts </H3> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">4. To select a particular Anglo-Saxon text, click on the
		central box and then scroll up and down or use one of the ordering or searching
		boxes at the top. Anglo-Saxon texts are identified by their author, title and
		edition (in summary form), and by a reference number (for Old English texts
		this is the number of the text in Angus Cameron's 'List of Old English Texts',
		printed in <U>A Plan for the Dictionary of Old English</U>, edited by R. Frank
		and A. Cameron (Toronto, 1973), preceded by C; for Latin texts it is the number
		given in the list of Anglo-Latin texts being prepared by Michael Lapidge and
		Rosalind Love, preceded by L). The date is that on which this set of entries
		was first published; if subsequent additions or corrections were made, the date
		will be given in the 'Updated' box. The transmission box records brief
		information about the transmission of an immediate source to the author who
		drew on it, or on the possible relationship of alternative sources, or about
		the likely relationship of an antecedent source to an immediate one. The
		bibliography includes secondary works drawn on by the contributor, which have
		provided new information about the identification of sources or analogues. </P>
	 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">5. When you have found and highlighted the text you want,
		click on <B><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">Show Sources for Selected A-S Text</FONT></B>
		at the bottom left to get a list of passages in that text for which sources
		have been identified. Scroll down to find the passage you want, or use one of
		the boxes at the top to find a particular source or passage.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Use the <U>Reset</U> button to change the criteria for a
		search.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Passages in the Anglo-Saxon text are identified by
		line-numbers or other appropriate reference, and by the opening and closing
		words (or a full quotation if it is very short). Source texts are identified by
		their author (including Anonymous and <I>Biblia Sacra</I> for books of the
		Bible), title, and edition (in abbreviated form), followed by a location
		reference and the opening and closing words of the relevant passage. (<FONT
		SIZE="-1">NOTE:</FONT> For citations from the Bible, source quotations are
		often not given since they are so readily accessible.) We use as far as
		possible standard, widely accessible editions of source-texts to make it easy
		for users to follow up references, especially on databases such as PLD
		(Patrologia Latina Database) and Cetedoc (Library of Christian Latin Texts on
		CD-ROM). These are not always the most recent editions, and in some cases
		different editions of the same text have been cited, usually because they
		contain distinct versions of the source-text. If you need an explanation of the
		location references, check the source texts in the bibliography.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Any comments by the contributor on the particular passage
		or its source, details of source studies relevant to the particular passage,
		and details of manuscripts which provide an unprinted source-text, or a
		significant variant reading, may appear in the boxes labelled Comment,
		Bibliography and Manuscript. The BHL number relates to hagiographic sources,
		and refers to the number given for that text in <I>Bibliotheca Hagiographica
		Latina</I> (2 vols., Brussels 1898-1901; <I>Subsidia hagiographica</I> 6); with
		supplements in 1911 (<I>Subsidia hagiographica</I> 12) and 1986 (<I>Subsidia
		hagiographica</I> 70).</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The <U>Explain Sigla</U> box gives you a drop-down menu
		which explains the various sigla used to define the nature of the source
		relationship - a certain or only probable or possible source, a direct or
		antecedent source, a single source or one of two or more cited for that
		passage.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">When you have highlighted a particular Anglo-Saxon passage
		and its source in this way, you can find out more about the use of that
		particular source text by Anglo-Saxon writers generally by clicking on the blue
		<B><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">Source Text</FONT></B> box at the bottom to switch to
		the Source Texts screen. This will take you to the same passage but now viewed
		in the context of other uses of the same source. For instance, if you select
		the first Anglo-Saxon Text in the list, Abbo of Fleury's <I>Passio
		Eadmundi</I>, the first record shown will cite a passage drawing on the Bible,
		specifically the Book of Judges; clicking on the <B><FONT
		COLOR="#3333FF">Source Text</FONT></B> box will take you to a list of passages
		from the Book of Judges used in Anglo-Saxon Texts, starting with the Abbo
		example and continuing with examples from Bede and the Old English Heptateuch.

	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">7. Click on <B><FONT COLOR="#3333FF">Show Source
		Texts</FONT></B> at top right to get a list of all the sources recorded for
		Anglo-Saxon Texts in the database. (NOTE: some texts will appear in both lists;
		thus Abbo of Fleury's <I>Passio Eadmundi</I> appears as an Anglo-Saxon Text
		because it was written in Anglo-Saxon England, but it also appears as a Source
		Text because it was used as a source in other Anglo-Saxon Texts, such as
		&AElig;lfric's Life of St Edmund.) To select a particular Source Text, scroll
		up and down or use one of the boxes at the top to find the one you want.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">8. When you have found the Source Text you want, click on
		<B><FONT COLOR="#993333">Show A-S References to Selected Source</FONT></B> to
		get a full list of the passages from that Source Text which are recorded in the
		database as being used by Anglo-Saxon Texts. The passages are listed in order
		of the Source Item number if there is one (this is the number of the item
		within a particular collection of works by a single author, e.g. the sermons or
		letters of Augustine), and otherwise by location (page or column reference, or
		book and chapter number, etc., in the specified edition of the source), but you
		can rearrange the list in the order of the Anglo-Saxon authors who use that
		source, using the box at the top, or select a particular passage using other
		boxes.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">9. When you have highlighted a particular passage of a
		Source Text and the Anglo-Saxon Text passage which uses it in this way, you can
		click on the red <B><FONT COLOR="#993333">Anglo-Saxon Text</FONT></B> button at
		bottom left to switch to the Anglo-Saxon Texts screen. This will take you to
		the same passage but now viewed in the context of other passages from the same
		Anglo-Saxon Text. For instance, if you select the first Source Text in the
		list, Abbo of Fleury's Passio Eadmundi again, the first record shown will cite
		a passage used in &AElig;lfric's Old English Passion of St Edmund. Clicking on
		the <B>Anglo-Saxon Text</B> button will take you to the full list of passages
		from that text, with the current passage highlighted. This will enable you, for
		instance, to view what other sources might be cited for the same Anglo-Saxon
		passage, and what sources are cited for the preceding and following Anglo-Saxon
		passages.<BR> Use the <B>Return</B> button at bottom left to return to the

	 <H3 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Tips"></A>Tips and Warnings</H3> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">1. Computer applications are not good at sorting numbers
		into the correct sequence unless the numbers are of very limited kinds, and
		these limitations are hard to reconcile with the traditional ways in which
		texts and editions are referred to. You will often find that numbers like 2 and
		3 come after 10 and 11, or 72 after 121, since the application likes to sort by
		the first digit. We have corrected this wherever we can but do watch out for
		sequences which are not in the expected order, e.g. passages from a text, such
		as lines 23-30 coming after lines 111-5, or numbered texts by the same author,
		or numbered items within a text; you will often find the item you want by
		scrolling down the list.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">2. The category 'Source Texts' includes some texts that are
		not in fact sources but are cited as analogues where no source has been
		identified but the presence of similar details in another text, perhaps a
		contemporary or later one, testifies to the use of a source which may be lost
		or yet to be discovered. These are not marked as analogues in the main listings
		but are shown by the sigla SX or MX in the individual records. </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">3. The Bibliography includes under Source Studies not only
		the expected modern critical studies which are cited within the database, but
		also some editions of AS Texts which have been cited because they include
		significant discussions of sources, and some alternative editions of Source
		Texts because they include significant variant versions which have been cited
		in the database. Thus Scragg 1992 may be listed as the specified edition of an
		AS Text (the Vercelli Homilies) and as the specified edition of certain
		source-texts which are only accessible in his apparatus or commentary, but also
		as a Source Study for the identification of particular sources. Fabricius 1719
		is listed as the specified edition of certain source texts, but also appears
		under Source Studies when it is cited for its variant versions of other source
		texts. As an edition, Scragg 1992 and Fabricius 1719 will appear in the
		Bibliography under the edition field; as a source study they will appear in the
		author field. </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">4. Re-attributions and new identifications of source texts
		<BR>Source texts are identified by their author, title and edition. In
		identifying authors we have tried to keep abreast of modern re-attributions and
		identification, but since these are constantly changing users should be
		prepared to look for other possibilities (e.g. by consulting <I>Clavis Patrum
		Latinorum</I> for patristic texts). Texts formerly ascribed to a known author
		but now of unknown authorship will appear, e.g., as Anonymous (Ps.Bede) or
		Anonymous (Ps.Gregory). Texts formerly attributed to one author but now
		ascribed to another might appear, e.g., as Quodvultdeus (Ps.Augustine).</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">5. Anonymous Texts <BR>Since an enormous number of
		Anglo-Saxon texts are anonymous, we have divided Anonymous as author into two
		major groups, Anon (OE) and Anon (Lat.), for English and Latin texts, and
		further separated Anon (OE Martyrology) to isolate the nearly 300 texts which
		form the Old English Martyrology. In the list of Source Texts, there are again
		many that are anonymous, and there is often no consensus about the titles of
		works. Many anonymous works in English are given here with titles beginning Old
		English. Hagiographic works will generally begin Acta, Passio or Vita.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">6. If you have a relatively slow PC you may find that the
		Source Texts page takes a long time to load, since it is calculating details
		for the whole database. If you know what you are looking for you may find it
		quicker to use the Author Reference Summaries to locate the Source Author and
		Text.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="LEFT">7. If you are using your own Access 2000 program to run the
		application and have not installed the Runtime version, you will find that as
		you navigate between different 'pages' of the application a small window or tab
		appears at the foot of the screen for each of them. It is possible to navigate
		back and forth by clicking on these instead of using the Return buttons within
		the application; <B>but if you do the application will soon crash and you will
		have to exit and open it again</B>. If you wish to avoid the temptation you can
		try installing the Runtime version as shown above even if you have Access 2000
		already, and the windows will then not appear. But such installation is
		somewhat unpredictable and <B>we do not recommend it</B>.</P>
