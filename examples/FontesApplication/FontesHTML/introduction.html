	 <H3><A NAME="aims">Aims of the Project</A></H3> 
	 <P>The Register aims to identify all written sources which were
		incorporated, quoted, translated or adapted anywhere in English or Latin texts
		which were written, or are likely to have been written, in Anglo-Saxon England,
		including those by foreign authors. It also identifies the written sources used
		by authors of texts written abroad if those authors are certainly or arguably
		Anglo-Saxons, and by foreigners who were drawing mainly on materials which they
		had obtained, or are likely to have obtained, in Anglo-Saxon England. </P> 
	 <P>Anglo-Saxon England is defined as England up to 1066, but a text is
		sourced whether it is extant in a pre-1066 copy or only in a later one. A text
		written after 1066 is included in the project only if it is of a type
		characteristic of England before 1066. An identifiable source is recorded
		whether or not it is extant. Oral sources and booklists are excluded.</P> 
	 <P><A HREF="#top">Back to the top</A></P> 
	 <H3><A NAME="history">History of the Project</A></H3> 
	 <P>The initial impulse for a large-scale project to study and record the
		written sources of Anglo-Saxon authors came at a one-day conference on sources
		at the University of Leeds in March 1984, organized to publicize a proposal
		made at the Symposium on the Sources of Anglo-Saxon Culture held in conjunction
		with the 1983 International Congress on Medieval Studies at Western Michigan
		University to revise J. D. A. Ogilvy's Books known to the English, 597-1066
		(Cambridge, MA, 1967). At the Leeds Conference, J. E. Cross and Malcolm Godden
		gave papers on the sources of some of the Vercelli homilies and of &AElig;lfric
		respectively, and in the discussion which followed, the desirability of
		establishing a rather different project, along the lines of <I>Fontes
		Anglo-Saxonici</I>, was agreed by all present. A small steering committee was
		set up, which met subsequently on a number of occasions at King's College,
		London, during the summer of 1984. At some of its meetings representatives of
		the informal group of American scholars concerned with the 'revised Ogilvy'
		project (subsequently named Sources of Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture) were also
		present, and the separate aims and objectives of the two schemes were
		clarified. The steering committee established an Executive Committee for
		<I>Fontes</I> with Peter Clemoes as Director, Joyce Hill as General Secretary,
		Michael Lapidge as Executive Secretary for Anglo-Latin, and Donald Scragg as
		Executive Secretary for Old English. </P> 
	 <P>Planning and setting up the project in every detail necessarily formed a
		lengthy initial stage, but since then a substantial body of material has been
		assembled. First of all, the Executive Committee, on the basis of work done by
		various subcommittees, approved guidelines for the submission of entries to a
		computer database, housed at the University of Manchester. Then followed the
		recruitment of a body of scholars worldwide. Next the database was created by
		Dr Marilyn Deegan, whose work during a one-year full-time appointment as a
		Research Assistant to the project was funded by the University of Manchester's
		Research Support Fund. Processing of the contributions received from scholars
		and their incorporation in the database were achieved to begin with by the
		half-time appointment for two years of Mrs (now Dr) Wendy Collier as a Research
		Assistant, funded by the University of Manchester Research Support Fund.
		Subsequently continuation of Dr Collier's work was supported by grants from the
		British Academy. From 1991 onwards advances on the Old English side of the
		project were greatly assisted by a succession of appointments of research
		associates funded by the British Academy and its Humanities Research Board, and
		subsequently by the Arts and Humanities Research Board. </P> 
	 <P>These research associates compiled material for a substantial range of
		material: </P> 
	 <P>1992-3 Dr Joan Hart (now Joan Hart-Hasler): King Alfred's version of the
		<I>Regula Pastoralis</I>, the Old English Bede, Canons of Edgar, Apollonius of
		Tyre </P> 
	 <P>1995-7 Dr Mark Atherton: anonymous homilies and saints' lives;
		&AElig;lfric's <I>De Temporibus Anni</I>; as well as processing work from
		outside contributors </P> 
	 <P>1995-2002 Dr Rohini Jayatilaka: &AElig;lfric's Supplementary Homilies
		and Saints' Lives; W&aelig;rferth's translation of Gregory's <I>Dialogues</I>;
		Old English Orosius; Old English Benedictine Rule</P> 
	 <P> 1997-8 Dr Christine Rauer: Lives of St Machutus and Chad; the Old
		English Martyrology </P> 
	 <P> 1998-9 Dr Daniel Anlezark: Old English Daniel and Azarias; Old English
		Exodus</P> 
	 <P>1999 Dr Brad Bedingfield: &AElig;lfric's homilies Assmann 5 and 6;
		&AElig;lfric's <I>Interrogationes Sigewulfi in Genesin</I> </P> 
	 <P>Work on the Anglo-Latin side was substantially advanced in 1996 by the
		appointment of Dr Rosalind Love as Humanities Research Board Institutional
		Fellow at Robinson College Cambridge, to work on the project; she has covered
		the Latin charters, the Latin saints' lives and the works of Bede (in
		progress). Following Dr Love's appointment to a lectureship in the Department
		of Anglo-Saxon Norse and Celtic at Cambridge, Dr Katherine Scarfe-Beckett
		succeeded to the HRB Institutional Fellowship in 2000 and completed work on the
		sources for Bede's <I>Historia Ecclesiastica</I>. </P> 
	 <P>Other material has been contributed by members of the project, and by
		scholars elsewhere. [See list of '<A HREF="textslist.html">Texts included in
		the Database</A>']</P> 
	 <P>In 1995 the database was moved from the mainframe computer at Manchester
		to a PC-base using the Paradox database system, and Dr Orchard became database
		manager. In 1998 the main database was relocated at Oxford, with Dr Jayatilaka
		as database editor and Professor Godden as database director, and work began on
		creating a web-mounted version, with the help of Paul Groves of the Humanities
		Computing Development Team at the Oxford University Computing Service. This was
		made available to the public for the first time on 1 August 1999. In 2002 the
		present CD-ROM version of the database was created with the help of David Miles
		of Oxford Database Design. The project aims to incorporate additional records
		from time to time and to issue at least one updated version on CD-ROM.</P>

	 <H3><A NAME="about">About the Database</A></H3> 
	 <P>Currently the database covers about 1150 Anglo-Saxon texts, over 500 in
		Old English and over 600 in Latin. For the full list see '<A
		HREF="textslist.html">Texts included in the Database</A>' (or to see the list
		of authors covered so far, go into the database and scroll down the list under
		Anglo-Saxon Texts). Nearly a thousand source-texts have been so far cited, from
		Abbo to Wulfstan.</P>

	 <H3><A NAME="acknowledging database">Acknowledging the Database</A></H3> 
	 <P>The records for each text were compiled by the individual contributors
		named in the general information for that text, using either their own
		unpublished research or published work by themselves or others as noted in the
		bibliographical information provided with the records, or a combination of the
		two. Any user wishing to employ material drawn from the database in their own
		publications should acknowledge the <I>Fontes</I> database and, where
		appropriate, the individual contributor and the published work cited in the
		bibliographies.</P>

	 <H3><A NAME="what">What can I do with the database?</A></H3> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>You can select an Anglo-Saxon text (whether Old English or Latin) and
		  get a report of all the sources used for it, passage by passage, sometimes
		  phrase by phrase, matched to a precise location in the source text. </LI> 
		<LI>You can get a summary account of all the different source authors
		  used by a particular Anglo-Saxon author, or of all the sources used for a
		  particular Anglo-Saxon text, and follow up those in which you are
		  interested.</LI> 
		<LI> You can pick a text used as a source, and ask for a list of all the
		  Anglo-Saxon texts that used that source, and follow up the examples that
		  interest you. Or, after choosing a source-text, you can select the Anglo-Saxon
		  texts which you want to know about. </LI>

	 <H3><A NAME="features">Features of the Database</A></H3> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Anglo-Saxon texts are identified by their author, title and edition
		  (in summary form). The particular passage is identified by its line-numbers or
		  other appropriate reference, and by the opening and closing words (or a full
		  quotation if it is very short). Information about the contributor, transmission
		  of sources, and any bibliography of source-studies for that text appear when
		  the text is selected. </LI> 
		<LI>Source texts are identified by their author (including Anonymous and
		  <I>Biblia Sacra</I> for books of the Bible), title, and edition (in abbreviated
		  form). We use as far as possible standard, widely accessible editions of
		  source-texts to make it easy for users to follow up references, especially on
		  databases such as PLD (Patrologia Latina Database) and Cetedoc (Library of
		  Christian Latin Texts on CD-ROM). These are not always the most recent
		  editions, and in some cases different editions of the same text have been
		  cited, usually because they contain distinct versions of the source-text. In
		  identifying authors we have tried to keep abreast of modern re-attributions and
		  identifications, but since these are constantly changing users should be
		  prepared to look for other possibilities (e.g. by consulting <I>Clavis Patrum
		  Latinorum</I> for patristic texts). </LI> 
		<LI>Individual source-identifications are accompanied by a sigil
		  indicating 'source-status' - that is, is it a single source or one of several
		  (alternative or combined) sources for that passage? Is it a certain source, or
		  a probable one, or just a possible one, or an analogue? A brief key to sigla
		  can be found by clicking on the Explain Sigla box when looking at the details
		  of any passage.</LI>
