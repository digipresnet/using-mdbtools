	 <P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Fontes Anglo-Saxonici: A Register of Written
		Sources Used by Anglo-Saxon Authors</FONT></I> is designed to identify all
		written sources which were incorporated, quoted, translated or adapted in Old
		English or Latin texts written in Anglo-Saxon England (i.e. England up to
		1066), or by Anglo-Saxons in other countries.</B> </P> 
	 <P><B>The material is compiled in the form of a database which analyses
		each Anglo-Saxon text passage by passage, sentence by sentence or, if
		necessary, phrase by phrase, identifying the probable source-passages used for
		each particular segment. The database has been accumulating material since 1988
		and in its present form contains over 29,000 records analysing in detail the
		source-relationships of around 1150 Anglo-Saxon texts (over 500 written in Old
		English and over 600 in Latin) and identifying the use of over 1000 sources and
		analogues. The database shows which texts were known in Anglo-Saxon England,
		how well specific texts and authors were known, and in what different ways they
		were used. It also provides the basis for studies on the intellectual interests
		of Anglo-Saxon authors, and what contributions the Anglo-Saxons made to the
		history of ideas.</B></P> 
	 <P><B>Not all Anglo-Saxon texts are covered in the present version. In some
		cases this is deliberate policy: though there are many views about the possible
		influences of other Old English or Latin texts on, say, Old English poems such
		as <I>The Wanderer</I> or <I>Beowulf</I>, there is little agreement and there
		is in any case not usually the clear passage-for-passage evidence of influence
		and reading that the project aims to chronicle. In other cases, particularly
		Anglo-Latin texts, work is still in progress or anticipated, and we hope to
		produce a still fuller version of the database at some future date.</B></P>
